DETERMINISTIC WALLETS:
- Generate all keys from one master seed
- Easy backup becuse it just save 12-word seed phrase
- Can recreate all keys from seed
- Organized key structure (BIP32 hierarchy)

NON-DETERMINISTIC WALLETS:
- Each key is randomly generated independently
- Must backup every single private key separately
- Lose a key is equal to losing those funds forever
- No relationship between keys

WHY DEVELOPERS PREFER DETERMINISTIC
1. User Experience
- Users only remember one seed vs many keys
2. Backup Safety
- One backup protects entire wallet
3. Recovery
- Can restore wallet on any device with seed
