1. Security
- Hardened keys are more secure - if someone gets your public key, they cannot figure out your private keys while
Non-hardened keys are vulnerable to this attack.

2. Key Derivation
- Hardened keys use private key + chain code to generate children while 
Non-hardened keys use public key + chain code

3. Public Key Sharing
- Non-hardened keys allow you to share public keys and generate child public keys without private keys while
Hardened keys require private keys for all operations.
